npm i react-colorify
```

**Using yarn:**

```

**Using pnpm:**

```

# Usage

Before using the component, you need to import it in your project:

```js
import Colorify from "react-colorify";
```

> NOTE: This only works with "Client Component" so make sure you are importing the component with "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Once you imported it, you can use the component in your project using the following code:

```jsx
<Colorify defaultValue={color} onChange={setColor} />
```

Further, you can also pass the following props to the ColorPicker component to customize it according to your needs.

# Props

### 1. `defaultValue`: #{string} | transparent;

The default Hex color value to be displayed in the color picker. You can also pass the value `transparent` to display a transparent color.

eg: `defaultValue="#000000"` or `defaultValue="transparent"`

### 2. className?: string;

A string of custom classes to style the component. By default, the component will always have the class "`react-colorify`".

eg: `className="flex w-full mx-auto items-center justify-center h-[400px]"`

### 3. onChange: (color: #{string}) => void;

A function that will be called whenever the color is changed in the color picker. The function will receive the new color value as a parameter. You can use this function to update the color value in your state.

eg: `onChange={(color) => setColor(color)}`

### 4. labelFor?: string;

A string to specify the label for the color picker. If provided, the color picker will open when the label is clicked. This is useful when you want to open the color picker on clicking a label. Remeber to add the `htmlFor` attribute to the label with the value of the `labelFor` prop.
